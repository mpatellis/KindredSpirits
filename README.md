# KindredSpirits

KindredSpirits is a C program I wrote for Sean Szumlanski's Computer Science 1 course in spring of 2017. The file KindredSpirits.c is my work everything else is the wonderful Sean Szumlanski's work. 

The program is based around recursive tree traversals. The program checks if a tree is a reflection or a kindred spirit. A reflection is if two trees are symmetric in shape and values. Two trees are said to be kindred spirits if one's preorder traversal is the other's postorder traversal.

To run the code load both KindredSpirits.c and a test case file together.

For more detail on the program and how to run it, please check the assignment's pdf.
